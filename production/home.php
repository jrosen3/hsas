		The <strong>Harvard Student Art Show</strong> is a multi-day art exhibit held during Arts First Weekend. The show, put on by a team of approximately twenty students, aims to promote the visual arts at Harvard and provide students with the opportunity to exhibit and sell their work. The arts touch all corners of the campus and reach into neighboring communities; this event provides a unique opportunity to unite the university around the artwork of its members.
